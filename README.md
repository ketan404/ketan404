- 👋 Hi, I’m Ketan Kulkarni.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that is Open Source. I find Laravel to be a great framework for building web-based products.
- 🌱 I set up institutional knowledge bases and digital content repositories for Knowledge Management.
- 💞️ I’m looking for volunteers who might be interested in contributing to our project Smart Repository - A digital content repository.
